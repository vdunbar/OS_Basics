<h2>The Burden of Proof</h2>
<p>Science is a beautiful thing. It is a landscape of exploration and one that at its root is tasked with finding evidence, and establishing cause and effect. At a fundamental level, this implies that science should be able to answer questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I exercise daily, how is this likely to affect my cardiovascular (heart) health?</p>
<p>If we build a road here, how will the local population of bighorn sheep be affected?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you’ll discover throughout your degree, scientists tackle such questions through a combination of <strong>exploratory</strong> and <strong>confirmatory</strong> research. At the exploratory stage, ideas are generated and <em>associations</em> are discovered. Exploratory research gives rise to <strong>hypotheses</strong> that can then be tested through confirmatory research, which requires well-designed experiments. For instance, we have long known about the positive association between daily exercise and physical health. But establishing that daily exercise <em>causes</em> healthy outcomes is a different challenge.</p>
<p>An interdisciplinary research team at UBC tackled trying to answer this exact question <span class="citation">(Liu-Ambrose et al. <a href="#ref-liu-ambrose_effect_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, starting with the observed correlation between exercise and physical health, and then posing the following question, which they addressed with an experimental study design - a <strong>clinical trial</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Does strength training after experiencing a fall in an aging population reduce subsequent injuries from falling?</em></p>
<div class="lab">
<h5 id="exercise-and-positive-health-outcomes" class="unnumbered">Exercise and positive health outcomes</h5>
<p>Read the following abstract from liu-Ambrose et al’s paper "Effect of a Home-Based Exercise Program on Subsequent Falls Among Community-Dwelling High-Risk Older Adults After a Fall" <span class="citation">(Liu-Ambrose et al. <a href="#ref-liu-ambrose_effect_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Considering the following research question:</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p><em>Importance</em></p>
<p>Whether exercise reduces subsequent falls in high-risk older adults who have already experienced a fall is unknown.</p>
<p><em>Objective</em></p>
<p>To assess the effect of a home-based exercise program as a fall prevention strategy in older adults who were referred to a fall prevention clinic after an index fall.</p>
<p><em>Design, Setting, and Participants</em></p>
<p>A 12-month, single-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from April 22, 2009, to June 5, 2018, among adults aged at least 70 years who had a fall within the past 12 months and were recruited from a fall prevention clinic.</p>
<p><em>Interventions</em></p>
<p>Participants were randomized to receive usual care plus a home-based strength and balance retraining exercise program delivered by a physical therapist (intervention group; n = 173) or usual care, consisting of fall prevention care provided by a geriatrician (usual care group; n = 172). Both were provided for 12 months.</p>
<p><em>Main Outcomes and Measures</em></p>
<p>The primary outcome was self-reported number of falls over 12 months. Adverse event data were collected in the exercise group only and consisted of falls, injuries, or muscle soreness related to the exercise intervention.</p>
<p><em>Results</em></p>
<p>Among 345 randomized patients (mean age, 81.6 [SD, 6.1] years; 67% women), 296 (86%) completed the trial. During a mean follow-up of 338 (SD, 81) days, a total of 236 falls occurred among 172 participants in the exercise group vs 366 falls among 172 participants in the usual care group. Estimated incidence rates of falls per person-year were 1.4 (95% CI, 0.1-2.0) vs 2.1 (95% CI, 0.1-3.2), respectively. The absolute difference in fall incidence was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.04-1.78; P = .006) falls per person-year and the incident rate ratio was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.46-0.90; P = .009). No adverse events related to the intervention were reported.</p>
<p><em>Conclusions and Relevance</em></p>
<p>Among older adults receiving care at a fall prevention clinic after a fall, a home-based strength and balance retraining exercise program significantly reduced the rate of subsequent falls compared with usual care provided by a geriatrician. These findings support the use of this home-based exercise program for secondary fall prevention but require replication in other clinical settings.</p>
<p><em>Trial Registration</em></p>
<p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT01029171; NCT00323596</p>
<h5 id="discussion" class="unnumbered">Discussion</h5>
<ul>
<li>Was this study confirmatory or exploratory? Why?</li>
<li>Who participated in the study?</li>
<li>What was the intervention?</li>
<li>What were the main conclusions?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="causal-links" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Causal Links</h3>
<p>Suggesting a causal link brings with it the need to show your proof. This burden of scientific proof requires both creativity and rigour; studies must be well designed and well executed. It also requires that studies be <em>independently replicated</em> to show that, if repeated, they will result in the same conclusions, reinforcing the validity of their findings.</p>
<p><em>Ask yourself this question</em> Would you try a new medication that was verified by a single research lab to have no side-effects? Or would you prefer a medication that was verified by five independent researchers in five different labs?</p>
</div>
<div id="science-social-trust" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Science &amp; Social Trust</h3>
<p>Science does not exist independent of the rest of society. The outputs of science - the discoveries from research - are used in all facets of life, addressing questions such as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a healthy lunch option?</p>
<p>Is lead-based paint safe?</p>
<p>What’s the safest way to perform heart surgery?</p>
<p>What should government policy be on climate change?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If science is going to be used by the public, other scientists, and policy makers to address these questions, they need to have trust in research findings and access to these findings.</p>
<div id="trust-access" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Trust &amp; Access</h4>
<p>Scientists can build public trust in science through the use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rigour in the scientific method; and</li>
<li><strong>Replication</strong> (thorough repetition) of studies to build and solidify the evidence for a conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can assure access to science by removing barriers to access, such as financial barriers to articles and by tailoring communication of the outputs for specific audiences.</p>
</div>
<div id="stakeholders-in-science" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Stakeholders in Science</h4>
<p>Designing accessible outputs for a particular audience means considering the prior knowledge, education, and needs of different <strong>stakeholders</strong> in science.</p>
<p>Who exactly is a stakeholder? Anyone who can influence or be affected by a matter. Examples of these could include government policy makers and funders, business and industry, politicians, environmentalists, patients, and the general public.</p>
